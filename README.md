# Aether

**Hyperchaos-driven agile quantum-secure communication framework**

Aether dynamically switches between multiple QKD protocols and NIST post-quantum algorithms at sub-50 ms intervals, making the active cryptographic layer unpredictable to any attacker — today or in 2035.

### Core Features
- Real-time switching: MDI-QKD ↔ BB84 (decoy-state) ↔ Kyber-768 ↔ Dilithium-3  
- Decision engine: 3D hyperchaotic map (coupled modified Lozi maps with time-delayed feedback) seeded by live QRNG  
- Lyapunov dimension > 6.0 · Decision latency < 2 µs  
- NIST SP800-90B compliant entropy · Real quantum hardware ready
