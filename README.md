# Aether
A high-dimensional hyperchaotic map constructed by coupling three modified Lozi maps with time-delayed cross-feedback, driven by live quantum random seed from real QRNG. Produces cryptographically secure pseudo-random sequences with Lyapunov dimension > 6 while maintaining &lt; 2 µs decision latency.
